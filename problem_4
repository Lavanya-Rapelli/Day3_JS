/*Problem: Complex Number Operations**

1. Define two complex numbers `z1` and `z2` (e.g., `z1 = 2 + 3j` and `z2 = 4 - 2j`).
2. Perform the following operations and print the results:
    - Addition of `z1` and `z2`
    - Subtraction of `z2` from `z1`
    - Multiplication of `z1` and `z2`
    - Division of `z1` by `z2`
3. Print the real and imaginary parts of each result separately.
